## Core workflows
Description of at least 2-3 real workflows as explained by the domain expert

- Workflow 1
  - Trigger/start condition: Customer wants to dine at a restaurant
  - Steps involved (in order):
    - Customer browses restaurants
    - Checks real-time table availability
    - Selects date, time, and party size
    - Confirms reservation
    - Receives reservation confirmation
  - Outcome / End condition:
    Reservation is created and table is marked as reserved

- Workflow 2
  - Trigger/start condition: Customer arrives at the restaurant
  - Steps involved (in order):
    - Staff verifies reservation
    - Customer checks in within grace period
    - Table status updated to occupied
  - Outcome / End condition:
    Customer is seated and reservation is marked as arrived

- Workflow 3
  - Trigger/start condition: Customer does not arrive within the grace period
  - Steps involved (in order):
    - System marks reservation as no-show
    - Table is released
    - Table becomes available for walk-ins or future reservations
  - Outcome / End condition:
    Seating capacity is restored and table is reused

## Rules, Constraints, and Exceptions
Document rules that govern how the domain operates.
  - Mandatory rules or policies:
    - Each reservation must support full CRUD operations
    - Reservation-related operations must follow ACID properties
  - Constraints or limitations:
    - Limited number of tables and seating capacity
    - Fixed restaurant operating hours
  - Common exceptions or edge cases:
    - Late arrivals within grace period
    - Partial party arrival
  - Situations where things usually go wrong:
    - Overlapping reservations
    - Incorrect table status updates
    - No-shows during peak hours

## Current challenges and pain points
- What parts of this process are most difficult or inefficient?
  Handling peak-hour reservations and walk-ins simultaneously.

- Where do delays, errors, or misunderstandings usually occur?
  During manual check-in and table reassignment after no-shows.

- What information is hardest to track or manage today?
  Real-time table status and accurate arrival tracking.

## Assumptions & Clarifications
- What assumptions made by the team that were confirmed
  - Reservation and table data require strong consistency
  - CRUD and ACID properties are mandatory for booking workflows

- What assumptions that were corrected
  - Staff interactions are critical and must be modeled explicitly, not treated as background operations

- Open questions that need follow-up
  - Handling reservation deposits or advance payments
  - Policy for repeated no-shows
